Week 5 Trivia Game

# JavaScript Assignment 2

### Overview

In this assignment, You'll create a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML.

### Before You Begin

1.  Create a GitHub repo called `TriviaGame`, then clone the repo to your computer.

2.  Create a file inside of the `TriviaGame` folder called `index.html`. This is where you'll mark up all of your HTML.
3.  Don't forget to include a script tag with the jQuery library.

4.  Create a folder inside of the `TriviaGame` folder called `assets`.
5.  Inside `assets`, create three folders: `css`, `javascript`, `images`

    - In your `css` folder, create a `style.css` file.
    - In your `javascript` folder, create an `app.js` file; here you'll write all of your JavaScript and jQuery.
    - In your `images` folder, save whatever images you'd like to use in this exercise.

6.  Choose a game to build from your options below.

### Advanced Assignment (Timed Questions)

- You'll create a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

- If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, display the next question -- do this without user input.

- The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

  - If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
  - If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.

- On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
